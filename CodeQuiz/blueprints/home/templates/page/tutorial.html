        <h2>Basic usage</h2>
        <section class="lead">
            After selecting the language you are working with, you can start typing away in the editor. Otherwise, you can simply copy
            and paste your code from your favourite IDE and submit it.
            <br><br> The number of test cases and the inputs for the test cases will be read from the standard input. After
            cleaning the standard input, the answer you give must then be printed to the standard output. Don't worry if
            you don't understand what we're saying now. We'll go through some examples in this document.

        <h2>Simple Example: Summation</h2>
        <section class="lead">
            <p>
                Assume we have the following problem where we are given some list of numbers and the question is: "What is their sum?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually, we will start off by telling you the expected input you'd receive and go on to tell you what is the output of the
                answer we expect. The game can contain X number of test cases and in each test case, contain Y number of
                trials. You won't need to worry about the number of test cases. However, you'll have to take care of the
                number of trials if we specify them. For example, in this case, we have 1 test case and 3 trials. Therefore,
                the input could look like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-markdown">
                    3             # number of trials in 1 test case
                    1 2 3 4 5 6   # input 1
                    2 3 4 5 6     # input 2
                    6 5 -1 2 2    # input 3
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p> All your output needs to be printed to standard output (described further below). Thus, returning to the example,
                the correct answer will have an output that looks like this:</p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-markdown">
                    21
                    20
                    14
                </code>

            <p>Essentially, printing to standard output is as easy as <code>print()</code> in Python. There are equivalents in R and the other languages so we won't go through all of them here. However, one last thing to note is that you should only <strong>print</strong> your final answer because we register that as your intended solution. </p>
