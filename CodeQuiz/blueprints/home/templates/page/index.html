                    This application contains some questions which can be solved by the knowledge that you've learnt throughout your ESD course.
                    Of course, some may require you to read out of the textbook. But we hope you'll still be challenged and
                    find the job in coding out solutions. We believe that if you can teach a computer how to get things done,
                    it must also mean you more or less know how to do it too!!
                </p>
